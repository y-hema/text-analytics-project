      "Monica: There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!\n",
      "Joey: C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!\n",
      "Chandler: All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?\n",
      "Phoebe: Wait, does he eat chalk?\n",
      "(They all stare, bemused.)\n",
      "Phoebe: Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!\n",
      "Monica: Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.\n",
      "Chandler: Sounds like a date to me.\n",
      "[Time Lapse]\n",
      "Chandler: Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.\n",
      "All: Oh, yeah. Had that dream.\n",
      "Chandler: Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.\n",
      "Joey: Instead of...?\n",
      "Chandler: That's right.\n",
      "Joey: Never had that dream.\n",
      "Phoebe: No.\n",
      "Chandler: All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me. \n",
      "Monica: And they weren't looking at you before?!\n",
      "Chandler: Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!\n",
      "[Time Lapse, Ross has entered.]\n",
      "Ross: (mortified) Hi.\n",
      "Joey: This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.\n",
      "Monica: Are you okay, sweetie?\n",
      "Ross: I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...\n",
      "Chandler: Cookie?\n",
      "Monica: (explaining to the others) Carol moved her stuff out today. \n",
      "Joey: Ohh.\n",
      "Monica: (to Ross) Let me get you some coffee.\n",
      "Ross: Thanks.\n",
      "Phoebe: Ooh! Oh! (She starts to pluck at the air just in front of Ross.)\n",
      "Ross: No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?\n",
      "Phoebe: Fine! Be murky!\n",
      "Ross: I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.\n",
      "Monica: No you don't.\n",
      "Ross: No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!\n",
      "Joey: And you never knew she was a lesbian...\n",
      "Ross: No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?\n",
      "Chandler: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (They all stare at him.) Did I say that out loud?\n",
      "Ross: I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.\n",
      "Monica: Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., \"I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren.\" was what? A wrong number?\n",
      "Ross: Sorry.\n",
      "Joey: Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?\n",
      "(Ross gestures his consent.)\n",
      "Joey: Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!\n",
      "Ross: I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!\n",
      "(Rachel enters in a wet wedding dress and starts to search the room.)\n",
      "Chandler: And I just want a million dollars! (He extends his hand hopefully.)\n",

      "Rachel: Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!\n",
      "Waitress: Can I get you some coffee?\n",
      "Monica: (pointing at Rachel) De-caff. (to All) Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (to Rachel) This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross? \n",
      "Rachel: Hi, sure!\n",
      "Ross: Hi. \n",
      "(They go to hug but Ross's umbrella opens. He sits back down defeated again. A moment of silence follows as Rachel sits and the others expect her to explain.)\n",
      "Monica: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?\n",
      "Rachel: Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- (to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. (to Monica) So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.\n",
      "Monica: Who wasn't invited to the wedding.\n",
      "Rachel: Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue... [Scene: Monica's Apartment, everyone is there and watching a Spanish Soap on TV and are trying to figure out what is going on.]\n",
      "Monica: Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it. \n",
      "Chandler: (imitating the characters) Tuna or egg salad? Decide!\n",
      "Ross: (in a deep voice) I'll have whatever Christine is having.\n",
      "Rachel: (on phone) Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me! \n",
      "(The scene on TV has changed to show two women, one is holding her hair.)\n",
      "Phoebe: If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off. \n",
      "Chandler: (re TV) Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants. \n",
      "Joey: I say push her down the stairs. \n",
      "Phoebe, Ross, Chandler, and Joey: Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!\n",
      "(She is pushed down the stairs and everyone cheers.)\n",
      "Rachel: C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!\n",
      "Ross: You can see where he'd have trouble.\n",
      "Rachel: Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica. \n",
      "Monica: Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...\n",
      "Rachel: Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!\n",
      "[Time Lapse, Rachel is breating into a paper bag.]\n",
      "Monica: Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...\n",
      "Phoebe: (sings) Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, (Rachel and Monica turn to look at her.) bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string. These are a few...\n",
      "Rachel: I'm all better now.\n",
      "Phoebe: (grins and walks to the kitchen and says to Chandler and Joey.) I helped!\n",
      "Monica: Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life. The whole, 'hat' thing.\n",
      "Joey: (comforting her) And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.\n",
      "Monica: Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!\n",
      "Joey: What, like there's a rule or something?\n",
      "(The door buzzer sounds and Chandler gets it.)\n",
      "Chandler: Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.\n",
      "Paul: (over the intercom) It's, uh, it's Paul.\n",
      "Monica: Oh God, is it 6:30? Buzz him in!\n",
      "Joey: Who's Paul?\n",
      "Ross: Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?\n",
      "Monica: Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?\n",
      "Ross: He finally asked you out?\n",

      "Monica: Rach, wait, I can cancel...\n",
      "Rachel: Please, no, go, that'd be fine!\n",
      "Monica: (to Ross) Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?\n",
      "Ross: (choked voice) That'd be good...\n",
      "Monica: (horrified) Really?\n",
      "Ross: (normal voice) No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!\n",
      "Phoebe: What does that mean?  Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot? (Chandler doesn't know.)\n",
      "(There's a knock on the door and it's Paul.)\n",
      "Monica: Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. (They are all lined up next to the door.)... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.\n",
      "All: Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!\n",
      "Chandler: I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?\n",
      "Monica: Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...\n",
      "Ross: A wandering?\n",
      "Monica: Change! Okay, sit down. (Shows Paul in) Two seconds.\n",
      "Phoebe: Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.\n",

      "Joey: Hey, Paul!\n",
      "Paul: Yeah?\n",
      "Joey: Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.\n",
      "Monica: (yelling from the bedroom) Shut up, Joey!\n",
      "Ross: So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?\n",
      "Rachel: Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!\n",
      "Ross: Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- (thinks) -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.\n",
      "Chandler: (deadpan) Yes, and we're very excited about it. \n",
      "Rachel: Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight. It's been kinda a long day.\n",
      "Ross: Okay, sure.\n",

Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look, look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel, but it isn't me, it's not me.

      "Ross: That only took me an hour.\n",
      "Chandler: Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.  You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.  Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it! I don't think that was my point!\n",
      "Ross: You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...\n",
      "Joey: What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!\n",

      "Paul: Isn't there?\n",
      "Monica: Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?\n",

      "152:\tEmily: No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit.\n",
      "153:\tRoss: She said what?\n",
      "154:\tEmily: She said, \"If Im not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it.\"\n",
      "155:\tRoss: Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? Do you my sisters teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? (He puts his pants on backwards.) This isnt right.\n",
      "156:\tEmily: I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, Im sure theyll come back when we can do it right.\n",
      "157:\tRoss: I cant ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that? (Holds out his pants)\n",
      "158:\tEmily: Dont you point your pants at me! (She throws them on the floor.) We have no choice! Anywhere thats half-decent wouldve be booked months ago, Ross dont you understand? This is our wedding Im talking about.\n",
      "159:\tRoss: The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when were getting married.\n",
      "160:\tEmily: So what are you saying? Its now or never?\n",
      "161:\tRoss: No. Im saying its now. (He starts putting on his pants, backwards again.)\n",

      "163:\tRoss: Theres no or in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!\n",
      "164:\tEmily: Its not the pants. Its you that is backwards. And if, and if you dont understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldnt get married at all! (She storms out.)\n",
      "165:\tRoss: (chasing her, trying to zip up his pants. His got them on right now.) No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please(He catches something important in the zipper and howls like a little boy and falls to the floor.)\n",

      "179:\tRachel: Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?\n",
      "180:\tPhoebe: Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didnt feel like getting up. Okay, Im gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And youre going to remember all of the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.\n",
      "181:\tRachel: I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.\n",
      "182:\tPhoebe: Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross, I think hes such a great guy. Here. (Hands her the picture, Rachel grabs it out of her hand.) Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that youre with Ross okay and imagine that youre kissing him. And youre-youre running your hands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross its some kind of grease, itsuck! Hah?\n",
      "183:\tRachel: I dont know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and yknow it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.\n",
      "184:\tPhoebe: Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, lets try some uh, aversion therapy.\n",
      "185:\tRachel: Okay.\n",

      "223:\tMonica: She said that?!\n",
      "224:\tRoss: Yeah.\n",
      "225:\tMonica: Why?!\n",
      "226:\tRoss: I dont know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.\n",
      "227:\tMonica: Oh my God. Youre even dumber than I am!\n",
      "228:\tRoss: Excuse me?\n",
      "229:\tMonica: Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?\n",
      "230:\tRoss: I dont know. A month?\n",
      "231:\tMonica: Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. Thats what we did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake (Starting to cry), with the little people on top. (Ross gets thrown a box of Kleenex from the bathroom and he gives her one.) Thanks. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.\n",
      "232:\tRoss: I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.\n",
      "233:\tMonica: Sometimes we were.\n",

      "645:\tMonica: Yeah, y'know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldn't have to worry about the salmonella. (Ross pushes her.) But of course with salmon you'd have to worry about the chickenella... So, I can't wait to see this place you're getting married!\n",
      "646:\tRoss: Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emily's parents got married here.\n",
      "647:\tEmily: I still can't believe they're tearing it down. It really is the most lovely building you'll ever see. I mean it's over... (She stops suddenly, when she sees that demolition has already started.) Oh my God!\n",

      "671:\tMonica: You're gonna find a place. But even if - God forbid - you didn't.. So you postpone the wedding. Is that really so bad? I mean, think about it.

But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn't mean that-that I'm still in love with him. Y'know? I-I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him-Ohh! Oh my God!

      "698:\tRachel: Oh, I can not believe you didn't tell me!\n",
      "699:\tPhoebe: Well, because we thought you knew!! It's so obvious! God, that would be like telling Monica, \"Hey, you like things clean.\" Or, y'know, \"Hey, Joey, you're gay.\"\n",

      "709:\tChandler: All right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you? Don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?\n",
      "710:\tJoey: Oh, I embarrass you? \n",
      "711:\tChandler: How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you?\n",
      "712:\tThe Vendor: He's just jealous. You'll fit right in; all Londoners wear them!\n",
      "713:\tChandler: Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?\n",
      "714:\tThe Vendor: (looks around) They're all tourists.\n",
      "715:\tChandler: All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y'know, you're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.\n",
      "716:\tJoey: Oh yeah? (Puts the hat on.) If you're gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.\n",
      "717:\tThe Vendor: Good choice.\n",
      "718:\tJoey: Thanks.\n",

      "725:\tRoss: Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think we'll be able to find a new place for the wedding.\n",
      "726:\tEmily: We don't have to.\n",
      "727:\tRoss: Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?\n",
      "728:\tEmily: No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit.\n",
      "729:\tRoss: She said what?\n",
      "730:\tEmily: She said, \"If I'm not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it.\"\n",
      "731:\tRoss: Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? Do you my sister's teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? (He puts his pants on backwards.) This isn't right.\n",
      "732:\tEmily: I realise that people are going to be disappointed. But, I'm sure they'll come back when we can do it right.\n",
      "733:\tRoss: I can't ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that? (Holds out his pants)\n",
      "734:\tEmily: Don't you point your pants at me! (She throws them on the floor.) We have no choice! Anywhere that's half-decent would've be booked months ago, Ross don't you understand? This is our wedding I'm talking about.\n",
      "735:\tRoss: The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when we're getting married.\n",
      "736:\tEmily: So what are you saying? It's now or never?\n",
      "737:\tRoss: No. I'm saying it's now. (He starts putting on his pants, backwards again.)\n",
      "738:\tEmily: Or?\n",
      "739:\tRoss: There's no 'or' in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!\n",
      "740:\tEmily: It's not the pants. It's you that is backwards. And if, and if you don't understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn't get married at all! (She storms out.)\n",
      "741:\tRoss: (chasing her, trying to zip up his pants. His got them on right now.) No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please-(He catches something important in the zipper and howls like a little boy and falls to the floor.)\n",

      "746:\tPhoebe: So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?\n",
      "747:\tRachel: Manhattan does not have enough stores.\n",
      "748:\tPhoebe: Well, I think I can help you get over him.\n",
      "749:\tRachel: You can?\n",
      "750:\tPhoebe: Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.\n",
      "751:\tRachel: Um-hmm.\n",
      "752:\tPhoebe: And a small piece of chocolate.\n",
      "753:\tRachel: Okay.\n",
      "754:\tPhoebe: And a glass of tepid water. (She gathers up all of these things.)\n",
      "755:\tRachel: Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?\n",
      "756:\tPhoebe: Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn't feel like getting up. Okay, I'm gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you're going to remember all of the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.\n",
      "757:\tRachel: I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.\n",
      "758:\tPhoebe: Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross, I think he's such a great guy. Here. (Hands her the picture, Rachel grabs it out of her hand.) Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that you're with Ross okay and imagine that you're kissing him. And you're-you're running your hands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it's some kind of grease, it's-uck! Hah?\n",
      "759:\tRachel: I don't know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y'know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.\n",
      "760:\tPhoebe: Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, let's try some uh, aversion therapy.\n",
      "761:\tRachel: Okay.\n",
      "762:\tPhoebe: Okay?\n",
      "763:\tRachel: All right.\n",
      "764:\tPhoebe: So uh, now look at the picture...\n",
      "765:\tRachel: Okay.\n",
      "766:\tPhoebe: All right, and umm... (She grabs the picture and smacks her in the head.) \n",
      "767:\tRachel: Ow!\n",
      "768:\tPhoebe: Okay, how do you feel now?\n",
      "769:\tRachel: Well, I like you less!\n",

      "771:\tChandler: Well, this is just as boring in England.\n",
      "772:\t(Joey returns, still wearing his hat.)\n",
      "773:\tJoey: Hey.\n",
      "774:\tChandler: Hey. (He nods at the hat.)\n",
      "775:\tJoey: Oh. (Takes off the hat.) Sorry!\n",
      "776:\tChandler: No-no-no, y'know what? I really shouldn't have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn't cool. And if it makes you feel any better, I've had a really lousy day.\n",
      "777:\tJoey: Me too.\n",
      "778:\tChandler: Yeah?\n",
      "779:\tJoey: Noo!! I've had the best day ever! Dude, check this out! Now, I'm gonna fastforward past the part with you, 'cause it is boring.\n",
      "780:\tMonica: (entering) Hey!\n",
      "781:\tJoey: Sh-shh-shh! (He motions for her to watch something he has taped.)\n",
      "782:\t[Cut to the tape Joey made in front of some famous place in London with a rather famous English-type person.]\n",
      "783:\tJoey: (on tape) Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat. \n",
      "784:\tFergie: (Yep, Sarah, the Duchess of York) Okay, so umm, what's your friend's name?\n",
      "785:\tJoey: (on tape) Oh, Chandler.\n",

      "788:\tMonica: Oh my God!\n",
      "789:\tJoey: That's Fergie baby!!\n",
      "790:\tFergie: Joey says you don't really like his hat, but I think it's kinda dashing.\n",
      "791:\tJoey: (on tape) So, I hear you're single now...\n",
      "792:\tFergie: Yeah, ummm, I don't like the hat that much. (She smiles.)\n",
      "793:\tChandler: How did you? How? How?\n",
      "794:\tJoey: Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right? So, I'm in my map and-and...(Ross enters) Hey!\n",
      "795:\tMonica: Hey!\n",
      "796:\tRoss: Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.\n",
      "797:\tMonica: (laughs) Yes, I did! And you are welcome!\n",
      "798:\tRoss: Am I?! And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!\n",
      "799:\tMonica: Umm...\n",
      "800:\tChandler: I'm gonna go to the bathroom.\n",
      "801:\tJoey: Wait up! (They both run to the bathroom.)\n",
      "802:\tRoss: Hey-hey, since you're the 'fix-it' lady, here's a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn't want to have the wedding at all?\n",
      "803:\tMonica: She said that?!\n",
      "804:\tRoss: Yeah.\n",
      "805:\tMonica: Why?!\n",
      "806:\tRoss: I don't know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.\n",
      "807:\tMonica: Oh my God. You're even dumber than I am!\n",
      "808:\tRoss: Excuse me?\n",
      "809:\tMonica: Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?\n",
      "810:\tRoss: I don't know. A month?\n",
      "811:\tMonica: Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That's what we did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake (Starting to cry), with the little people on top. (Ross gets thrown a box of Kleenex from the bathroom and he gives her one.) Thanks. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.\n",
      "812:\tRoss: I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.\n",
      "813:\tMonica: Sometimes we were.\n",
      "814:\tRoss: Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?\n",
      "815:\tMonica: Okay.\n",
      "816:\tRoss: Come on. (They leave and Chandler sticks his head out.)\n",
      "817:\tChandler: That was pretty intense huh?\n",
      "818:\tJoey: Yeah. (Pause) Hey, I hope Ross didn't think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!\n",
      "819:\tChandler: (glares at him) I hope he did!\n",
      "820:\t[Scene: Monica and Rachel's. Phoebe is on the couch, and Rachel is sitting on the chair.]\n",
      "821:\tPhoebe: Ooh! I thought of a good flaw! Ross pops his gum!\n",
      "822:\tRachel: Oh, right! (BEAT) Wait a minute, I do that too.\n",
      "823:\tPhoebe: Yeah, I know. It drives me crazy.\n",
      "824:\t(The phone rings.)\n",

      "829:\tPhoebe: Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the-that looks just like you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say 'hi!' but then I figured, he doesn't care if he looks like you.\n",
      "830:\tJoey: That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?\n",
      "831:\tPhoebe: Ohh, they're having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe! Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?\n",
      "832:\tJoey: Kinda, but I've just been having way too much fun.\n",
      "833:\tPhoebe: So you're not homesick yet?\n",
      "834:\tJoey: No, I don't think so.\n",
      "835:\tPhoebe: All right, the seven of us miss you.\n",
      "836:\tJoey: Who's seven?\n",
      "837:\tPhoebe: Y'know, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies...\n",
      "838:\tJoey: Ahh, the babies miss me?\n",
      "839:\tPhoebe: Of course they do! Or I'm just really hungry.\n",
      "840:\t(There is a knock on Rachel and Phoebe's door.)\n",
      "841:\tPhoebe: Ooh, the pizza guy's here!\n",
      "842:\tJoey: What? You ordered pizza without me?!\n",
      "843:\tPhoebe: Yeah. But y'know we were thinking about you, y'know we ordered the Joey Special.\n",
      "844:\tJoey: Two pizzas?!\n",
      "845:\tPhoebe: Yep! Okay, gotta go, talk to you later.\n",
      "846:\tJoey: Wait, well, where did you get it from?! \n",
      "847:\t(Phoebe has already hung up, leaving Joey in the dark. So Joey decides to watch some TV and turns on a rerun of Cheers, with the theme song playing. At first, he's happy, but as the song progresses Joey gets depressed and homesick.)\n",

      "851:\tEmily: I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen.\n",
      "852:\t(At that Ross plugs in some Christmas lights to light the place up.)\n",
      "853:\tEmily: Oh God.\n",
      "854:\tRoss: Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y'know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles...\n",
      "855:\tMonica: And the musicians, look, they can go over here (Points to a little alcove), okay? And the chairs can face this way (Points), and... (Points to Ross) You go.\n",
      "856:\tRoss: But-but, if you don't love this, we'll do it in any other place at any other time. Really, it's fine, whatever you want.\n",
      "857:\tEmily: It's perfect.\n",
      "858:\tRoss: And, I don't know, if it starts to rain...\n",
      "859:\tEmily: Well then we'll get wet. (They kiss.)\n",
      "860:\tMonica: Ohh. And I don't even have a date.\n",

      "865:\tPhoebe: Yeah, it's in the guys' apartment under the sink. Why?\n",
      "866:\tRachel: (enters with a bag packed) Because I'm going to London.\n",
      "867:\tPhoebe: What?! What do you mean you're going to London?\n",
      "868:\tRachel: Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him. Now honey, you take care, you don't have those babies until I get back. (Kisses her stomach.) \n",
      "869:\tPhoebe: But what about all the \"finding-his-flaws\" stuff we've been doing?\n",
      "870:\tRachel: Yeah, that didn't work.\n",
      "871:\tPhoebe: I-Rachel, you can't go! Ross loves Emily!\n",
      "872:\tRachel: Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel! He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.\n",
      "873:\tPhoebe: That's not why you're going! You're going because you hope he's gonna say, \"Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget that British chippy.\"\n",
      "874:\tRachel: Ohh-Do you think he will?!\n",
      "875:\tPhoebe: No! Because he's in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if you go, you're just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Y'know, it's too late! You missed you're chance! I'm sorry, I know this must be really hard, it's over.\n",
      "876:\tRachel: Y'know what? No. It's not over until someone says, \"I do.\" (Exits)\n",
      "877:\tPhoebe: I do! I do! I do! (Chases her into the hall, but Rachel doesn't stop.) I do! (Gives up.) Ugh, like I can really chase you. I'm carrying a litter.\n",

      "882:\tHousekeeper: This is the housekeeper speaking. And by the way, young lady, that is not how one addresses a person on the telephone. First one identifies oneself and then asks for the person with whom one wishes to speak.\n",
      "883:\tPhoebe: What are you saying?!\n",
      "884:\tHousekeeper: Now, let us try that again, shall we?\n",

      "891:\tHousekeeper: I'm afraid, I'm not at liberty to divulge that information.\n",
      "892:\tPhoebe: Ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay. And I have to warn somebody, alright. So if you don't give me that number then I'm going to come over there and kick your snooty ass all the way to New Glocken..shire.\n",

      "1224:\tRachel: Whoa, wait, listen, I think I'm just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant.\n",
      "1225:\tMonica: Wait. Rachel, no, he's married. Married! If you don't realise that, I can't help you.\n",

      "1257:\tRachel: Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she's gonna get over this, y'know? I mean, so you said my name! Y'know you just said it 'cause you saw me there, if you'd have seen a circus freak, you would've said, \"I take thee circus freak.\" Y'know, it didn't mean anything, it's just a mistake. It didn't mean anything. Right?\n",
      "1258:\tRoss: No! No! Of course it didn't mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y'know, because-because it was you...\n",

      "1279:\tRachel: If anybody asks, I'm your sister, Joan. Listen. C'mon, you guys. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me! \n",
      "1280:\tChandler: (to Monica) Your sister Joan is crazy.\n",
      "1281:\tRachel: (They both just stare at her.)Y'know what? Fine, I don't care. Don't believe me, I know I'm right-do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?\n",
      "1282:\tChandler: Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.\n",
      "1283:\tMonica: Yes, I want to change. And why-why don't you go down and get us a table?\n",
      "1284:\tChandler: Yeah, we'll be down in like five minutes.\n",

      "1293:\tRachel: Well, Ross said my name.\n",
      "1294:\tPhoebe: Yeah, I know, but I don't think that means anything.\n",
      "1295:\tRachel: Okay, Pheebs, y'know what, let's look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then...\n",
      "1296:\tChandler: (To Monica) Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?\n",
      "1297:\tMonica: But my clothes are-ohh! (They both leave.)\n",
      "1298:\t(Cut to Chandler's room, he opens the door slowly to see if Joey is there and after seeing that he isn't, ushers Monica into the room, closes the door, and the security bar.)\n",

      "1306:\tJoey: Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?\n",
      "1307:\tChandler: Well, I suppose I'd have to say you!! But, what if we're watching a movie in here?\n",
      "1308:\tMonica: Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It's My Giant!\n",

      "1314:\tChandler: Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.\n",

      "1316:\tChandler: Okay!\n",

      "1322:\tChandler: Well, you couldn't have looked everywhere or else you would've found her!\n",
      "1323:\tMonica: Yeah, I think you should keep looking!\n",
      "1324:\tChandler: Yeah, for about 30 minutes.\n",
      "1325:\tMonica: Or 45.\n",
      "1326:\tChandler: Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice. (Monica smiles at that.)\n",
      "1327:\tRoss: No! For all I know, she's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept moving around. No, from now on, I'm staying in one place. (He sits down on the bed.) Right here.\n",
      "1328:\tMonica: Well, it's getting late.\n",
      "1329:\tChandler: Yeah, we're gonna go.\n",

      "1341:\tChandler: We can't do that that's insane. I mean 'A' he could wake up and 'B' y'know, let's go for it.\n",

Oh yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything, Okay? She's-she's just a friend and that's all! (Rachel sits down, depressed.) That's all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you'll tell her that.\n",

      "1874:\tMonica: Okay. That's okay. I-I know that you're very upset right now. I know, I know that wasn't about me.\n",
      "1875:\tJoey: (To Chandler) I bet it was about her a little.\n",
      "1876:\tMonica: If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! (Gunther turns to listen in.) I mean, he's nice, he's cute.\n",
      "1877:\tRachel: Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda\n",
      "1878:\tMonica: (Interrupting) Oh, what about that guy over there? (She points at another guy and Gunther is deflated.) Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.\n",
      "1879:\tRachel: Oh, I don't know. I don't know.\n",
      "1880:\tMonica: You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your decisions and I say you're going to talk to him.\n",
      "1881:\tRachel: All right, you're the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me.\n",
      "1882:\tJoey: Say that to him and you're golden. (She just glares at him.)\n",

      "1888:\tChandler: All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we?\n",
      "1889:\tPhoebe: No. I'm sorry. It's just 'cause I couldn't be there. 'Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.\n",
